a republican strategy to counter the re - election of obama
republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud .
however , the brennan centre considers this a myth , stating that electoral fraud is rarer in the united states than the number of people killed by lightning .
indeed , republican lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the united states in a decade .
one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turn - out .
in this sense , the measures will partially undermine the american democratic system .
unlike in canada , the american states are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the united states .
it is in this spirit that a majority of american governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult .
this phenomenon gained momentum following the november 2010 elections , which saw 675 new republican representatives added in 26 states .
as a result , 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone .
