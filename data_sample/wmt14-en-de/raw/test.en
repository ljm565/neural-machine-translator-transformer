gutach : increased safety for pedestrian
they are not even 100 metres apart : on tuesday , the new b 33 pedestrian lights in dorfparkplatz in gutach became operational - within view of the existing town hall traffic lights .
two sets of lights so close to one another : intentional or just a silly error ?
yesterday , gutacht ' s mayor gave a clear answer to this question .
" at the time , the town hall traffic lights were installed because this was a school route , " explained eckert yesterday .
the kluser lights protect cyclists , as well as those travelling by bus and the residents of bergle .
the system , which officially became operational yesterday , is of importance to the sulzbachweg / kirchstrasse junction .
we have the museum , two churches , the spa gardens , the bus stop , a doctor ' s practice and a bank , not to mention the traffic from the ' grub ' residential area .
" at times of high road and pedestrian traffic , an additional set of lights were required to ensure safety , " said eckert .
this was also confirmed by peter arnold from the offenburg district office .
